To use: surround paragraphs to place a rule
with \startrule and \endrule.

E.g.:

\startrule 
This paragraph will have a rule around it.
\endrule

Multiple paragraphs can be spanned as well. Rules will break across
pages but it will have the effect of making your document
\raggedbottom. 

You can change the offset of the rule by setting \ruleoffset. Rules
are always offset from the left margin.

A simple \codeblock environment is included too.

To use it, surround the code with \codeblock{

}

Code must appear in the group. The group must immediately follow \codeblock.
Code is set ragged right, obeying newlines, using typewriter font.
